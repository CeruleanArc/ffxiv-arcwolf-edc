I made an app. It was *hard!* I'm tired now. Too tired to explain. Here is fast explanation.

Use it online or install it to your Android phone using your browser! Whatever you wanna do. I'm not the boss of you.
## Why Is It?
Oh I've said a bunch about that. First I wrote a big essay. It was a really good essay. The rationale is there, and a *lot* of math besides.

Then I wrote the revision, and that was *way* better. No more fractions. Nobody but me likes fractions. I love you, fractions. The math is better, and it covers what we do for Year Aught and to match all years thereafter in perfect sync.
