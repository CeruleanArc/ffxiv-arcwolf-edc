## Why Is It?
Oh I've said a bunch about that. First I wrote a big essay. It was a really good essay. The rationale is there, and a *lot* of math besides.

Then I wrote the revision, and that was *way* better. No more fractions. Nobody but me likes fractions. I love you, fractions. The math is better, and it covers what we do for Year Aught and to match all years thereafter in perfect sync.
